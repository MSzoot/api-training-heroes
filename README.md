## Hero Pictures Gallery App
[getmyheropicture.netlify.app](https://getmyheropicture.netlify.app)

Super simple Vanilla JavaScript project I did to learn APIs. The app fetches data from an API and displays your chosen hero pictures. The app leverages the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests, handles the JSON response, and dynamically updates the DOM to present a delightful collection of hero images.

### Features
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Uses the Fetch API to retrieve random hero pictures.
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Adds images to the webpage in real-time based on API responses.
